# Target

  Target is a multiplayer 2D hack-and-slash kind of game, created by 1st semester students of the Informatics Center, at the Federal
  University of Pernambuco (Centro de Informatica - CIn - UFPE), as a final project of the course Introduction to Programming.
  
# How to play

  All players must be connected in a LAN and using a Linux-based OS. To open the server, which is going to host the game, just double-
  click the Target Server file, located in the main directory.
  
  After the server is opened, it's just about connecting to it, using the game's client (Target Client). Users must get the host's IP Address (who can get it by entering
  "ifconfig" in the Terminal and connect using the game's menus.
  
  If the connection, for any reason, is unsuccesful, the player will be properly notified in-game.
  
  As soon as the player is connected, he'll be taken to the Team Selection lobby. He can choose between two teams - blue and red - and
  when the choice is made, press "ENTER" to confirm it. Your ready status will be confirmed when a small character appear just beside
  your nickname. Take a good look and memorize who you are, because that's the character you're gonna play with.
  
  When the game begins, both teams will have one player marked as the Target. The main objective is to kill the enemy's team target
  before they kill yours, being the winner the first one to do so. The team members can see which one of them is the Target by looking
  above the health hearts, located on the upper-left side of the screen.
  
  There are three classes: the Warrior, the Magician and the Archer.
  
  **Warriors** are melee combat players, whose attacks strike an area of 3 squares in front of the player, dealing 8 damage.
  
  The **Magician** is a ranged combat class. Its attacks are fast and powerful, however, they stop as soon as they find an object or player.
  It deals 6 damage.
  
  The **Archer**, like the Magician, has ranged attacks. They deal 8 damage and have the ability to penetrate through targets, only stopping
  when an object or rock is hit. Despite it being strong, archers can only shoot an arrow at a time. When a arrow is shot, the player can
  only shoot another when the previous one is dismissed (hitting objects/rocks). That being said, playing as an archer requires strategy
  and cold-bloodedness.
